# Group 1

### Problem 1.  Speakers and panels at conferences aren't diverse enough.

Tactics
a.  For audience members: make the organizers aware that you want more diversity. Be polite.
b.  For organizers, invite women and minorities first so they have a lot of time to plan. Send them a conference diversity calculator so they can easily figure out how many people of X type to invite [aanandprasad.com/diversity-calculator].
c.  For pre-audience members:  if you see a speaker series without much diversity, email the series organizer to let them know you'd like to see more women/racial minorities/ethnic minorities. Be ready to send a list of speakers who fit the diversity criteria you would like to see. 
d.  Use entrofy software for participant selection for workshops: works for any event where your group of participants is larger than your available attendance slots. 

### Problem 2.  Pipelines don't work well for under-privileged people.

Tactics

a.  Reach out to community colleges to give their students research experience, possibly using NSF REU programs.
b.  Bring the same students back for two summers or "runs" of a program so that they can see themselves building confidence.
c.  Ask Moore Foundation and your department, provost, adjacent departments for funding to take on a student from an under privileged background in your lab over the summer. 
d.  Build a website on which to collect resources that financially support diversity initiatives. 
e.  Volunteer to go to a high school, Boys & Girls Club, etc. to talk about your research.
f.  Get involved in outreach programs. 

### Problem 3.  There isn't widespread commitment to behavioral change around diversity and inclusivity. 

Tactics

a.  Dedicate time to talk about diversity initiatives, inclusivity activities, and outreach at conferences.
	i.  Present social science data as evidence. [Science article: http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6282/148.full]
	ii. Biases that show up in recommendation letters [slowe.github.io/genderbias/], job postings [joblint], also proof of retention issues for women and minorities.

### Problem 4.  There aren't enough women and POC at the faculty level.

Tactics

a. For any job: use structured interview questions, formal selection criteria, clear job descriptions with measurable expectations. 
b. Ensure all jobs are publicly advertised (this isn't a problem at the tenure level, but it is a problem at the clinical level, research scientist level).
c.  We don't have enough power to change faculty hiring yet. 
d.  Equal pay would be a great goal for women, people of color, non-traditional career paths.

### Problem 5.  There seems to be more support and activity around gender difference than racial diversity, ability, socioeconomic status, and LGBTQI differences.

# Group 2

## Points meembers brought up during our introduction

* diversity of backgrounds and perspectives

  * both as experts, and as people

* Vanderbilt has programs for:

  * nontraditional careers paths
  * people who left academia to start families
  * underrepresented groups

* benefits of different kinds of diversity

* establishing/finding/contributing to official presence

* how to talk to people from diverse backgrounds about issues that impact *them*, when you don't share that background

  * wanting to help but, as a privileged person, concerned about taking the initiative in prompting a discussion

    * maybe a person doesn't want to be the center of a discussion, or have their under-representation brought up for them

* as a mentor, how to foster a good environment
* how to be a good ally when you are in a privileged position


## How to foster a diverse, welcoming, inclusive environment...
when...

* you're a mentor/lab director
* you're a grad student / post-doc / lab member
* you're in all the in-groups
  * without being partonizing, presumptuous

You don't realize that some situations are problematic when your own experience is surrounded by that situation so that you never know anything else; being exposed to diverse sets of people bring that broader perspective to the table.

* working with people from diverse backgrounds means taking on the task of communicating across boundaries
  * you want to hold people to the same standard even when they are from different backgrounds
  * this requires some patience


## What makes one space feel safe/inclusive/diverse
* having people of diverse backgrounds
  * people don't feel excluded/alone/intimidated
* having a well-defined code of conduct
  * but how to communicate this to the lab?
  * lab-carpentry: establishing lab policy, expectations, mission statement
  * having lab retreats, that include open discussion of "is there anything that we can do that would improve this"
  * build that discussion into lab meetings - something you can actively do to begin baking the attitude into lab culture

* how to overcome difficulty in recruiting members for diversity organizations
  * incentives: teaching a course, having food
  * hosting workshops on career skills, bringing in speakers
  * but still, sometimes people attend just those events and not the regular organization meetings that are specifically related to diversity (example: AWM hosting seminars vs regular AWM meetings).

* Leading academic-toned discussion of in-group and out-group dynamics,
  * in order to recruit allies: making clear to in-group people that the point is not to blame them, but to discuss matter-of-factly what the reality is and how we can impact it

* Some out-group members might not be interested in attending because they feel such diversity-centered groups will not have an effect.
  * Actual story: slack announcement / message a little unofficial, describing the department's committment to diversity (following the election) made a lot of people feel better about the department's culture
  * having an element of unofficiality can make it more effective -- maybe because it is received as being more sincere?

* concern: incentivizing people who otherwise might be interested for only selfish reasons without wanting to contribute (i.e. by bringing food) might bring in people who will not contribute or even be counter-productive

* food is good way to build community,
  * potluck can make it equitable and particularly personal

### What works at the level of admin or university?

* U-Wash department put out a statement of commitment to diversity

* creating environments where people feel safe enough to talk

* diversity has benefits, but even if it was neutral, it's the ethical thing to do
  * another benefit: excluding any group means our community is that much smaller, losing that many more contributors to the community

* making positions more accessible to...
  * people from divers socio-economic bacckgrounds
  * people with learning disabiliities
    * we try to force them into the same perspective and background "the rest of us" conform to

## Actionable items
  * cut GRE
    * assumes a somewhat uniform kind of socio-economic-cultural background; has been shown to be biased

## How do the privileged be good allies
Beginning a conversation about how your underrepresented group is treated can be intimidating.
How can privileged people be good allies in this context?

* try to foster/empower people in those groups
* respect that we can't pull anyone into such a cconversation or organization, even if we think we are helping them
* developing a system to pair new-comers with mentors who have more experience at the lab

* aggregating the university/instutition level resources available for diverse groups!
  * there are a lot of organizations (Black Student Union, Association for Women in Math, e.g.)

* lack of accountability
  * wide-spread complaints about faculty in positions of power, but no record kept of misconduct because it gets wiped  between deans
  * granting organizations should have a way to check that PIs they grant have good records.

Suggestion: a secure, private, institution-level repository of records of complaints against faculty / PIs

* often the inappropriate behavior of people on power goes unreported


End on positive note:

* more people today (of post-doc-ish age) are aware of concept of privilege, e.g., than 8 years ago -- this conversation has been becoming more widespread and more important.
* Although our particular group was mostly white, half of the participants in this group were male (one female member mentioned she had expected the group to be all female, and was surprised)
