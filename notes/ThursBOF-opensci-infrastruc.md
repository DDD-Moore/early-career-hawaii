**1. Critical infrastructure people use / care about:**

- Github
- Travis CI
- LLVM
- Dryad
- Figshare
- OSF
- DockerHub
- CRAN
- PyPI
- Conda
- Slack
- Arxiv

**2. Why does this matter?**

- If github goes down for five minutes, everyone’s work is stalled
- Matters for repro, if the packages are down all the links/docs are broken
- Monocultures -- beyond single point of failure

Why are these for-profit? Problem w/ commercial services being so central

- Don’t have a problem with companies adding value
- But a built-in incentive to ramp up switching costs, keep you locked in
- Many funders don’t want their funds to go to for-profits
- Sustainability, regardless of for/non-profit
- Lower adoption if there is a perception of risk/collapse
- Platform/vendor lock-in. E.g. if jupyter project dies tomorrow, .ipynb files are easily opened/converted

Distinction between services and software -- 	doesn’t make sense to say “if python or r goes down”... but maintenance is also work, can have projects that stop being maintained, so it is unsafe to use them


**3. How has this problem come about?**

- Maintenance is hard, boring, and not rewarded (esp in academia)
- These for-profit services built on open source software have been adopted b/c they are easier to use, hard to get people to use IRC vs slack, for example
	
**4. Is this so big of a problem?**

- If github goes down, we can replicate with gitlab. Google code went down, we migrated
- These companies do provide a value-added
- If the NSF funded a slack/github replacement, it might look as terrible as fastlane
- Github is mainly used by tech industry, not science. But perhaps this is a good thing, it makes science more connected to non-scientists, gives scientists skills that are easily transferrable to industry
- Are these the same as genetic sequencers, etc.

**5. Funding/actions?**

- Are we talking about the kinds of projects that can be taken over by nonprofits/grants? Though if the NSF funded this, it’d look like fastlane 
- Funding a layer that would map replicated services, like a DOI for services
- IFTTT for science to automate redundancy 
	E.g. if you made a release on github, it archives it on figshare. Auto-archiving issues on github, convos on slack. 	Here is my slack, github, figshare, orcid accounts, go autoarchive it all
- We build $ into grants for proprietary software, build $ for donations to projects you use
	Writing a boilerplate text that says “this software project is important for this grant”. Or get this funded out of university overhead? Arxiv is funded this way.
- Build into data management plan -- this is necessary for long-term sustainability of the projects, if Jupyter or Julia stop being maintained, then this project is dead
- Treat it as an issue like funding open access publishing charges
- Moore program officers could lead by example, publishing a document saying they are funding projects which include line items for donations to relevant open source projects used in each grant
- Comparing what NSF/NIH vs other foundations are using as criteria?
	Who to target?
- NSF program officers are pretty forward looking, but NSF panel members are tenured profs who evaluate proposals. Need to reach out to domain scientists.
- Volunteer to be on NSF panels
- These problems are cultural problems that require changing hearts and minds, this is a social movement, how to engage in the right messaging and collective action? Learn from the open access publication movement (or work alongside). There are judging criteria for grants, these can be changed/expanded. In DMP: How are you going to support the projects you rely on?
	
	
Sourceforge being a good example of a worst/bad case scenario

Many of these services are based on open source projects, it just makes it easier and more user friendly

Slack is a particularly concerning platform for long-term planning. There is a message limit (waived for nonprofits), but still there is so much history that is important there
