## Symposium Code of Conduct

All attendees at our symposium are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody. We’ve written this code of conduct not because we expect bad behavior from our community—which, in our experience, is overwhelmingly kind and civil—but because we believe a clear code of conduct is one necessary part of building a respectful community space.

### The Quick Version
The symposium organizers are dedicated to providing a harassment-free symposium experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of symposium participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any symposium venue, including talks, workshops, social events, Twitter and other online media. Symposium participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the meeting at the discretion of the organisers.

### The Less Quick Version

We are committed to providing an environment that promotes inclusiveness, open and honest dialog, friendly interactions, and active listening. We want all participants to feel welcomed, heard, and supported. To that end, we will not tolerate any harassment in any form at our symposium.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the symposium organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the symposium.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a DDD or MMI representative immediately. You can make a report in the following ways:

- Email: ddd@moore.org or marinemicro@moore.org
- Phone: 650-597-3282 (650-597-DATA)
- Anonymously via this reporting form: [goo.gl/forms/nLtLzDqnkP](http://goo.gl/forms/nLtLzDqnkP)

DDD or MMI representatives will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the symposium. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and symposium-related social events.
