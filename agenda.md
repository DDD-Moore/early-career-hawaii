### Birds of a Feather Breakouts 

We will break into groups based on interest in possible topics of discussion. **See [Issues](https://github.com/DDD-Moore/early-career-puertorico/issues)** to comment on ideas or add your own topic.

<a name="beach"></a>
### Beachfront Agenda Planning 

We will use the end of Tuesday to determine how best to spend our time on Thursday. Why at the beach? Why not?!

<a name="poster"></a>
### Poster Activity/Session 

We will create posters as a large group based on overlapping areas of research and interest. These posters will be "presented" informally during the joint poster session with MMI on Wednesday.

<a name="panel"></a>
### Open Science Panel

The two keynote speakers for Wednesday (Lang and Cranmer) will be joined by Carly Strasser (DDD) and representatives from the MMI and DDD early career researchers present (to be named). The panel will be an informal Q&A session with heavy audience participation.

### BioBay Kayak Trip 

We have planned a kayaking trip to the Laguna Grande bioluminescent bay for the night of Wednesday, June 1. The trip is appropriate for all skill levels, and should take about 2.5 hours including a brief introduction to kayaking and the bio bay ecosystem. We have reserved a spot for all symposium attendees. If for any reason you wish to opt out of this trip, please [let us know](mailto:natalie.caulk@moore.org) asap. More information: [Fajardo Bio Bay](http://www.puertoricodaytrips.com/fajardo-bio-bay/)

### TBD: To Be Determined <a name="tbd"></a>

We will determine as a group how to best use these blocks of time based on the Beachfront Agenda Planning session on Tuesday.
