### Birds of a Feather Breakouts 

We will break into groups based on interest in possible topics of discussion. **See [Issues](https://github.com/DDD-Moore/early-career-hawaii/issues)** to comment on ideas or add your own topic.

<a name="beach"></a>
### Beachfront Agenda Planning 

We will use the end of Wednesday to determine how best to spend our time on Friday. Why at the beach? Why not?!

<a name="poster"></a>
### Poster Activity/Session 

Instead of a formal talk or poster presentation, we are holding a “Living Poster Session”. All participants will create their own “Living Poster” on Wednesday. You will sketch your research on a small poster-sized piece of paper we will provide, and during the meeting others will add their ideas, comments, questions, etc. This activity will be in conjunction with the MMI group.

### Keynote by David Lang

David Lang spends most of his time working on [OpenROV](http://www.openrov.com/), an open source underwater robot, and [OpenExplorer](https://www.openexplorer.com/home), a community of professional and amateur explorers around the world. He is a member of NOAA’s Ocean Exploration Advisory Board, a TED Senior Fellow, and a National Geographic Emerging Explorer. Prior to underwater robots, he managed a sailing school in Berkeley for a few years – David still sails as much as he can. If you want to hear the long story, there’s a [good interview on NPR](http://www.npr.org/2015/10/23/449202146/how-can-we-open-source-exploring-our-oceans). Recently, David wrote a boke: [Zero to Maker](https://www.amazon.com/Zero-Maker-Learn-Enough-Anything/dp/1449356435). You can read more of his musings on his [website](http://www.davidtlang.com/) or follow him on Twitter: [@davidtlang](https://twitter.com/davidtlang).

<a name="Cranmer"></a>
### Keynote by Kyle Cranmer

[Kyle Cranmer](http://physics.as.nyu.edu/object/kylecranmer.html) is an Associate Professor of Physics at New York University and affiliated with NYU's Center for Data Science. His work in experimental particle physics is based primarily at the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland. He was awarded the Presidential Early Career Award for Science and Engineering in 2007 and the National Science Foundation's Career Award in 2009. Professor Cranmer developed a collaborative statistical modeling framework, which was used extensively for the discovery of the Higgs boson. He is involved in a number of projects related to open science, reproducibility, sustainable software, and cyber infrastructure with the aim of enabling simultaneous inference over multiple products in the scientific record. His most recent research utilizes machine learning for likelihood-free inference. 


<a name="panel"></a>
### Open Science Panel

The two keynote speakers for Wednesday (Lang and Cranmer) will be joined by Carly Strasser (DDD) and representatives from the MMI and DDD early career researchers present (to be named). The panel will be an informal Q&A session with heavy audience participation.

### TBD: To Be Determined <a name="tbd"></a>

We will determine as a group how to best use these blocks of time based on the Beachfront Agenda Planning session on Wednesday.
