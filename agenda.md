### Beachfront Agenda Planning 

We will use the end of Tuesday to determine how best to spend our time on Friday. Why at the beach? Why not?!

<a name="poster"></a>
### Poster Activity/Session 

We will create posters as a large group based on overlapping areas of research and interest. These posters will be "presented" informally during the joint poster session with MMI on Thursday.

<a name="panel"></a>
### Open Science Panel

The two keynote speakers for Wednesday (Lang and Cranmer) will be joined by Carly Strasser (DDD) and representatives from the MMI and DDD early career researchers present (to be named). The panel will be an informal Q&A session with heavy audience participation.

### TBD: To Be Determined <a name="tbd"></a>

We will determine as a group how to best use these blocks of time based on the Beachfront Agenda Planning session on Wednesday.
